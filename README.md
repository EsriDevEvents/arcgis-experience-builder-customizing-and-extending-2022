# customizing-exb-builder-ds2022
A repository for code that was part of the ArcGIS Experience Builder: Customizing and Extending tech session.

The Simple widget code progressively builds upon each section of the session:

- [ts-01-select-from-data-sources](https://github.com/esridevsummit/customizing-exb-builder-ds2022/tree/main/ts-01-select-from-data-sources)
We start with the Simple widget in ExB

- [ts-02-select-from-data-sources](https://github.com/esridevsummit/customizing-exb-builder-ds2022/tree/main/ts-02-select-from-data-sources)
We then add a settings page to our Simple widget

- [ts-03-select-from-data-sources](https://github.com/esridevsummit/customizing-exb-builder-ds2022/tree/main/ts-03-select-from-data-sources)
Let's add some translations to our strings in the widget

- [ts-04-select-from-data-sources](https://github.com/esridevsummit/customizing-exb-builder-ds2022/tree/main/ts-04-select-from-data-sources)
This section shows how we can listen to the extent changed event

- [ts-05-select-from-data-sources](https://github.com/esridevsummit/customizing-exb-builder-ds2022/tree/main/ts-05-select-from-data-sources)
Finally, we add some logic to filter our feature service in the map widget
